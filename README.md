# Student Robotics IDE API for Java

The [Student Robotics](https://www.studentrobotics.org/) IDE has support for HTTP requests using JSON and I have made an INCOMPLETE Java API to use it. The IDE, CyanIDE, has a git repository [cyanide.git](https://www.studentrobotics.org/cgit/cyanide.git/) which was used to develop this.

This requires [JSON in Java](http://www.json.org/java/)

Currently, no buildscripts or unittests have been written.
