# Student Robotics IDE API for Java

The [Student Robotics](https://www.studentrobotics.org/) IDE has support for HTTP requests using JSON and I have made a Java API to use it.
Most API endpoints can be used, though not all.
The IDE, CyanIDE, has a git repository [cyanide.git](https://www.studentrobotics.org/cgit/cyanide.git/) which was used to develop this.

Developing
----------
[Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) is required

Setup eclipse: run `gradle eclipse` then import into a workspace

Build: run `gradle build`

Note: There are no unit tests at this time.
